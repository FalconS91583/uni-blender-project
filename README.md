# uni-blender-project
This project was created as part of completing my course at university, where the goal was to create a scene around a given element (in my case, this element is part of the vessel on the pedestal), I chose the Indiana Jones atmosphere, where all the elements of the scene were made by me, except for the skull on the right wall of the stage.
